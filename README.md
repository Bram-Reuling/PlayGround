# PlayGround

As the name already suggests, this is a play ground for developing mechanics and utilities and just general exploration in Unreal Engine. Feel free to use whatever you want from this project.
These mechanics are purely written by how I would implement things. 
**This is by no means THE way to do it.**

## Usage

Fork the repository and then clone it. Right-click on the `PlayGround.uproject` file and select `Generate Visual Studio project files`. After that you just double click on `PlayGround.uproject` and launch the editor.

## Contributing

As already stated above, this is just a playground for me to make and test things in. This means that I will not accept any contributions to this repository. Feel free to fork the project and work on your own fork!
